The project focuses on breath rate estimation using infrared thermal sensors.
Temperature variations during inhalation and exhalation are captured using the sensor. 
By analyzing the digital signal, we can detect abnormalities like tachypnea, bradypnea and apnea.
Overall, the project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of breathing data, enabling a better understanding of breathing patterns and their associated metrics.
